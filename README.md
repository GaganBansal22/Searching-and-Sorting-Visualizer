# Searching and Sorting Visualizer
## Description
The Searching and Sorting Visualizer is a web application that allows users to visualize the step-by-step process
of various searching and sorting algorithms.Users can see how algorithms like binary search, linear search, bubble sort, merge sort, etc.,
operate in real-time. Each algorithm is accompanied by its steps written in a clear and concise manner.

Key features include:
- Real-time visualization of algorithm steps
- Adjustable simulation speed to control the pace of the visualization
- Pausing and resuming functionality for detailed analysis of each step
- Detailed process and analysis of each algorithm, including time and space complexities

The visualizer empowers users to understand the inner workings of different algorithms by providing a dynamic and interactive 
learning experience. Whether you're a student learning algorithms or a seasoned developer refining your skills, the Searching and 
Sorting Visualizer offers a powerful tool for exploration and understanding.
